#Use this script to verify the correctness and completeness of your key-breaking software
#The script expects as input two files. The first is a list of known bad keys (we've provided 
#you some for the short key files); the second is your candidate list of broken moduli (e) and 
#corresponding private key (d). The format of the first file is a string, decimal representation 
#of an RSA moduli, one per line. The format of the second file is n:d, where n and d are string, 
#decimal representation of an RSA moduli and its corresponing private key d, delimited by a colon, 
#also one per line.
